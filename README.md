# üí´ About Me:
**Mechatronics Engineering and Robotics:**  
As a Mechatronics Engineering student at Mahindra University, I am deeply passionate about robotics and automation. My journey in this field has led me to become an active competitor in the IRoC-U, where I explore and push the boundaries of robotics and mechatronics. My skills in CAD design allow me to bring innovative concepts to life, creating complex mechanical parts and systems that integrate seamlessly with advanced electronics and control systems.

**Cybersecurity and Ethical Hacking:**  
Alongside my mechatronics expertise, I have a strong dedication to cybersecurity. Actively participating in CTF competitions and bug bounty programs has sharpened my skills in ethical hacking and digital security. I thrive on the challenge of identifying vulnerabilities and securing systems, continuously learning and applying the latest techniques to stay ahead in the ever-evolving field of cybersecurity.

**Freelancing and Innovation:**  
Beyond my academic pursuits, I engage in freelance projects that allow me to merge creativity with technical know-how. Whether designing intricate mechanical systems or tackling cybersecurity challenges, I approach every project with a problem-solving mindset and a commitment to excellence. My freelance work reflects my ability to adapt, innovate, and deliver results that make a real impact.
